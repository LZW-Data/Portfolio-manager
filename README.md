##Introduction
An initially Independent project aimed at producing a bot that will actively reposition a given portfolio according in order to outperform the market. We will start with a simplistic procedural approach that will take limited indicators and perform trades and then incrementally introduce more concepts. The eventual goal will be to have the bot be able to look at previous data assess the risks of the present positions and reposition to minimise risk and maximise gains. Eventually hopefully integrating news article searching and other more complex mechanisms.

##Technologies Used
*Python 3.6
*Numpy
*Pandas
*scikitlearn

##Setup
To run this project,

##Status
Presently working on the initial iteration of the project. This will involve setting up a bot that can trade paper stocks using a simple algorithm.
